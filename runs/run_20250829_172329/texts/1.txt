Abstract. One of the critical emerging challenges in climate change
communication is the prevalence of conspiracy theories. This paper dis-
cusses some of the major conspiracy theories related to climate change
found in a large Twitter corpus. We use a state-of-the-art stance de-
tection method to ﬁnd whether conspiracy theories are more popular
among Disbelievers or Believers of climate change. We then analyze
which conspiracy theory is more popular than the others and how pop-
ularity changes with climate change belief. We ﬁnd that Disbelievers of
climate change are overwhelmingly responsible for sharing messages with
conspiracy theory-related keywords, and not all conspiracy theories are
equally shared. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our ﬁndings for
climate change communication.

Introduction

There is a virtually 100% consensus among scientists that greenhouse gas emis-
sions from human activity cause climate change [12]. Despite the overwhelming
evidence, much public discourse shows open skepticism with many popular con-
trarian voices [13,6,17]. In fact, it is believed that between 20% to 40% of the
U.S. population considers climate change as a hoax or do not believe in its
anthropogenic cause [22].

Contrarian voices on climate change can be divided among diﬀerent cate-
gories. For instance, there is a category of people who argue that climate change
is real but is not caused by human activity. Another example would be peo-
ple who believe that climate change is real, but they dispute the anthropogenic
cause. However, the most alarming category are climate change deniers who
outright reject climate science ﬁndings or the data as a hoax. Diﬀerent ideolo-
gies drive most people who describe climate science ﬁndings and data as hoax
[22]. One such facet of ideology is conspiratorial thinking. Previous studies have
suggested that conspiratorial thinking is associated with beliefs about climate

change. In other words, individuals who believe in conspiracies are more likely
to refute the anthropogenic cause of climate change [22].

Conspiracy theories are “unsubstantiated explanations of events or circum-
stances that accuse powerful malevolent groups of plotting in secret for their own
beneﬁt against the common good” [22]. People who believe in conspiracy theory
might want to derive an explanation for any complex scientiﬁc fact from these
theories. Conspiracy theories can be interlinked with each other, although they
might not have any logical basis. In this paper, we would discuss some of the
major conspiracy theories in climate change that are popular on a social media
platform. These conspiracy theories present a signiﬁcant challenge in removing
the false narratives around climate change. Thus, it becomes essential to analyze
these conspiracy theories.

Previous work on climate change and conspiracy theories suggest that people
believing in conspiracy theories are likely to believe that climate change is a hoax
[22]. That work relied on the manual survey-based collection methods. Surveys
are limited in ﬁnding nuanced beliefs and in studying extensive social network
structures. This paper uses extensive Twitter data to link beliefs about climate
change and sharing of conspiracy related text. Thus, the main research question
we answer is, In climate change discussion, do climate change Disbelievers share
more conspiracy related terms compared to Believers? To answer this research
question, we scrape Twitter data for all the Tweets containing climate change
and conspiracy related keywords. We then use a state-of-the-art stance detection
method to ﬁnd climate change Believers and Disbelievers 3.

Moreover, conspiracies about climate change could be promulgated by bot-
like accounts - automated user accounts - in addition to human actors. These
bot-like accounts can further create confusion on well established climate change
realities. Previous studies have suggested that “bots seek to create false ampliﬁ-
cation of contentious issues with the intention to create discord” [20]. This paper
examines whether or not bot-like accounts are more active in sharing conspira-
torial messages in diﬀerent belief groups.

This paper begins by deﬁning some of the common climate change-related
conspiracy theories §2. Next, we discuss the method used to identify individual
beliefs, keywords used to identify the conspiracy theories, and method used to
ﬁnd bot-like accounts §3. We present our results in §4. Our results (§4) suggest
that Disbelievers share most conspiracy theory related Tweets. Conspiracy the-
ory related to chemtrails and geo-engineering is most popular in our dataset.
However, conspiracy theory related to ﬂat earth is most popular among Believ-
ers but rather used as a sarcasm. We also ﬁnd that most Disbelievers share only
one or two diﬀerent conspiracy theories with climate change discussion. Finally,
we discuss our ﬁndings and their implications in §5.

3 We deﬁne Believers as people who cognitively accept anthropogenic causes of climate

change Disbelievers as those who reject the same.

2 Major Conspiracies about Climate Change

Conspiracy theories evolve with time and do not follow logical arguments. This
section covers the most well-known conspiracy theories related to climate change
and gives brief backgrounds about each. The list was created based on the au-
thor’s ﬁndings, and readings of previous work on the same topic [23,20,22,19]4.

1. Deep state: Followers of this conspiracy theory agree that there is a hidden
government within the legitimately elected government that controls the
state. Climate change is a hidden agenda of the deep state to further the
deep’s states motives.

2. Chem Trails: The condensation trails from the jet engines of an aircraft are
erroneously recognized as consisting of chemical or biological agents. The
theory posits that these trails are responsible for climate change.

3. Sunspots: Sunspots are a temporary phenomenon of reduced temperature
on the Sun’s surface [18]. This theory asserts that sunspots and not human
activity are causing climate change.

4. Directed Energy Weapon (DEW): A human-made weapon that damages its
target by a highly focussed beam of energy. As per the proponents of this
theory, the usage of DEWs is causing climate change.

5. Flat Earth: Advocates of this conspiracy theory do not believe that the earth
is a sphere but rather believe that the earth is a ﬂat disc. Climate is hence
not governed by the standard scientiﬁc laws, and climate change is a hoax.
6. Geo Engineering: Enthusiasts of this conspiracy theory believe that govern-

mental experiments cause climate change.

7. Unknown Planet: A ninth planet with a vast orbit and unknown to humanity
is causing climate change. The eﬀect of the planet will keep on increasing as
it goes through its perigee.

3 Data Collection and Method

In this section, we ﬁrst describe our data collection in §3.1. Second, in §3.2, we
describe our method to ﬁnd climate change belief stance and the keywords used
to ﬁnd conspiracy theory related Tweets.

3.1 Data Collection

We collected tweets using Twitter’s standard API5 with keywords “Climate
Change”, “#ActOnClimate”, “#ClimateChange”. Our dataset was collected be-
tween August 26th, 2017 to September 14th, 2019. Due to server errors, the col-
lection was paused from April 7th, 2018 to May 21st, 2018, and again from May
12th, 2019 to May 16th, 2019. We ignore these periods in our analysis. After
deduplicating tweets, our dataset consisted of 38M unique tweets and retweets
from 7M unique users.

3.2 Method

This section will ﬁrst discuss the stance detection method used to identify cli-
mate change Believers and Disbelievers. Then, the keywords used to identify
conspiracy related Tweets.

Stance Detection: Labeling each user as a climate change Believer or a Dis-
believer is a non-trivial task. The broader ﬁeld of labeling users based on the
position the user takes on a particular topic is called stance mining [16]. We
use state-of-the-art stance mining method which uses weak supervision to ﬁnd
Believers and Disbelievers [15]. The model uses text signals from Tweets along
with retweet and hashtag network features using a co-training approach with la-
bel propagation [24] and text classiﬁcation. A set of seed hashtags are provided
as a pro and anti stance signals to the model. The model then labels seed users
based on the usage of these seed hashtags at the end of the tweet (endtags).
The labeled and unlabeled users are then taken as input to the co-training algo-
rithm. In each step, a combined user-retweet and user-hashtag network is used
to propagate labels to unlabelled users. Concurrently, the text classiﬁer uses the
seed user’s tweets to train an SVM [11] based text classiﬁer to predict unlabeled
users. A common set from text classiﬁcation and label propagation of highly
conﬁdent labels are then used as seed labels for the next iteration. The ﬁnal
classiﬁcation is based on the prediction of the joint model using the combined
conﬁdence scores.6 The model has been shown to be above 80% accurate with
multiple datasets.

We select hashtag #ClimateHoax and #ClimateChangeIsNotReal as Disbe-
liever seed hashtags and #ClimateChangeIsReal and #SavetheEarth as Believer
seed hashtags. Hashtags ClimateHoax has been shown to be used mostly by
Disbelivers [20,21]. We found similar results on using other Disbeliever hashtags
reported in [20,21]. We use ClimateChangeIsReal and SavetheEarth as Believer
hashtags because of their semantics. Out of the 7M users, we classiﬁed 3.1M as
disbelievers and 3.9M as believers 7.

Conspiracy Keywords: We use the following keywords to identify if a Tweet is
a conspiracy related Tweet.

1. Deep state: club of rome, clubofrome, clubrome, pizzagate, lizard people,

lizardpeople, illuminati, deepstate, deep state, qanon

2. Chem Trails: chemtrail, chem trail
3. Sunspots: sunspot

6 We use the parameter values as deﬁned in [15] as {k = 5000, p = 5000, θI = 0.1,

θU = 0.0, θT = 0.7}.

7 We randomly sampled 1000 users from each group to manually validate the results.
We label a user as Disbeliever if we ﬁnd any Tweet akin to someone who does
not believe in climate change or anthropogenic cause of climate change. Otherwise,
we label the user as Believer. We observe that the average precision from manual
validation of 2000 users is 81.2%.

4. Directed Energy Weapon: dew, directed energy weapon, directedenergy
5. Flat Earth: ﬂat earth, ﬂatearth
6. Geo Engineering: geo engineering, geoengineering, weather modiﬁcation, weath-

ermodiﬁcation

7. Unknown Planet: planet x, niburu

Bot Detection: We label an account as bot-like or not using CMU’s Bot-Hunter
[2,3]. Bot-Hunter’s output is a probability measure of bot-like behavior assigned
to each account.

4 Results

Climate change Disbelievers share more conspiracy related Tweets than climate
change Believers. We ﬁnd that the number of Tweets and Retweets shared by
climate change Believers (4830 and 3576) and Disbelievers (31084 and 14369) are
an order of magnitude diﬀerent. Disbelievers overwhelmingly share Tweets re-
lated to conspiracy theories. Interestingly, for both the groups, conspiracy theory
related Tweets are Tweeted more than Retweeted. This behavior is contrary to
the ﬁndings of most studies on Twitter which conclude that users prefer Retweet-
ing to Tweeting [5]. More Tweeting activity than Retweet activity suggests that
although conspiracy related Tweets can be found in climate change discussion,
not many users are re-sharing the message.

Once we know that Disbelievers are predominantly sharing the conspiracy
theory related Tweets, next, we ﬁnd which conspiracy theory is most popular.
We break down the Tweets/Retweets with the respective type of conspiracy
theory in ﬁgure 1. As expected, Disbelievers are sharing conspiracy theories
more than Believers. The most popular conspiracy theory among Disbelievers is
Geo-engineering and Chemtrails related conspiracy theory. On the other hand,
Believers are sharing Flat Earth conspiracy theory more than other conspiracies.
A manual analysis of 100 randomly selected Tweets show that the Flat Earth
conspiracy theory is used as a sarcastic comment or to make fun of the other
group. We provide further evidence by ﬁnding the average sentiment towards
conspiracy related keywords 8. Figure 1 reports the average sentiment in Tweets
towards conspiracy theory related words. Flat Earth conspiracy theory stands
out with negative sentiment, more so when shared by Disbelievers. In other
words, irrespective of beliefs about climate change, the Flat Earth conspiracy
theory is viewed negatively. Interestingly, Believers have a higher positive sen-
timent towards ChemTrails and Geo-Engineering conspiracy theories compared
to Disbelievers. We suspect that this could be attributed to Believers explaining
the actualities of these theories. More robust sentiment analysis with a labeled

8 To ﬁnd sentiment towards keywords, we utilize Netmapper [10] which uses a word-
level sentiment computation based on the average of known valences of surrounding
words within a sliding window. The output values are between -1 and 1, where neg-
ative value represents a negative sentiment, and a positive value represents positive
sentiment.

dataset is needed to draw detailed sentiment level conclusions; such analysis is
out of scope for this work.

Fig. 1. Number of unique Tweets and Retweets shared by Disbelievers and Believers
containing diﬀerent conspiracy theory related keywords deﬁned in §3.2 (left).Average
sentiment score towards the keywords related to diﬀerent conspiracy theories. A nega-
tive value means a negative sentiment and a positive value means a positive sentiment
towards the conspiracy keywords (right).

After analyzing the origin of diﬀerent conspiracy theories, next, we look at
the correlation of diﬀerent conspiracy theories shared by each user. In table 1,
we report the correlation between two diﬀerent conspiracy theories by ﬁnding
the number of times diﬀerent conspiracy keyword is used by each user. We ﬁnd
that most conspiracies are highly correlated with each other, indicating that
users who Tweet about one conspiracy also tweet about other conspiracies. The
Chemtrails and Unknown Planet conspiracies are least likely to be Tweeted
by a user who tweets other conspiracy theories. To further gain insight into
the sharing pattern, in ﬁgure 2 we report the number of users sharing unique
conspiracy theories. Even on a log scale, we see a steep decline in the number of
Believers and Disbelievers sharing diﬀerent types of conspiracy theories.

Next, we ﬁnd whether or not the same Tweet has more than one conspiracy
discussed. In table 2, we report the correlation between two diﬀerent conspiracy
theories by ﬁnding the number of times diﬀerent conspiracy keyword occurs in
the same Tweet. We notice in table 2 that there is a weak negative or close to zero
correlation between all the keywords belonging to diﬀerent conspiracy theories.
Twitter users prefer using conspiracy theory keywords independent of using other
conspiracy theory keywords in a Tweet. Moreover, conspiracy theories related
to Flat Earth and Geo Engineering are most negatively correlated (-0.338). In
other words, Twitter users using keywords related to Flat Earth do not use
keywords related to Geo Engineering in the same Tweet. Thus, we conclude
that most users share one or two types of conspiracy theory and most Tweets
have keywords related to one type of conspiracy. Moreover, this behavior does
not diﬀer from a change in climate change belief.

Lastly, we look at whether bot-like accounts drive the conspiracy theory re-
lated discussion. We ﬁnd that even at 0.7 probability cutoﬀ, about a quarter
of all users exhibit bot-like characteristics. We also ﬁnd that there is not much

diﬀerence in the activity between Disbelievers and Believers. Moreover, we ﬁnd
that most bots (∼88%) share only one type of conspiracy theory. This conclusion
is similar to the results described in ﬁgure 2, where we report the distribution
without separating bot-like accounts. Moreover, bot-like accounts also show a
similar pattern with regards to sharing the type of conspiracy theories. Bot-like
accounts showing behavior akin to Disbelievers share more conspiracy theories
related to Geo-engineering and Chem Trails. On the other hand, bot-like ac-
counts showing behavior akin to Believers share more conspiracy theories with
Flat Earth related keywords.

5 Discussion

Understanding people’s underlying beliefs helps understand the constructs by
which people could be attracted or repelled by diﬀerent messaging. People be-
lieving in conspiracy theories are more likely to believe that a conspiracy theory
is a possible explanation of climate change [22]. Hence, conspiracy theories could
be used as a potential recruitment tool by Disbeliever lobbyists. Celebrities and
politicians have been vocal about their criticism of science, even using conspiracy
theories as possible explanations for climate change [22]. These reasons make the
study of conspiracy theories in the climate change context even more relevant.
Conspiracy theories are a means for people to justify the actions of a powerful
entity or a person, mostly when those actions are not relatable [8,9]. [22] argue

8

that the inﬂuence of elites interacting with the masses predispositions explains
conspiracy thinking and why there is a partisan divide in such thinking. More-
over, President Donald Trump’s election has further enhanced this eﬀect and
could potentially lead to mass radicalization [1]. Conspiracy belief is thus linked
to people’s justiﬁcation of predisposed climate change belief. Future research on
conspiracy theories warrants these explanations to be looked at from the lens of
psychology and social science. In this paper, we ﬁnd that climate change Dis-
believers are more likely to share conspiracy theories. The conspiracy theories
range from deep state conspiracy theory, which portrays climate change as an
agenda of individual actors or deep state to possible explanatory theories such
as sunspots and chemtrails. Future research should look at these theories from
the lens of explanatory or motivated by partisanship.

Conspiracy theories are a real threat to eﬀective climate change messaging.
Climate change messaging should not indiscriminate all conspiracy theories but
tackle the popular ones and alienate the unpopular ones. Climate change commu-
nication research should look to evolve messaging in ways that take into account
diﬀerent beliefs. Conspiratorial thinking and reasoning to justify climate change
will dampen the global eﬀort to decrease climate change eﬀects. In this paper,
we show that most people sharing conspiracies in the context of climate change
only share one or two types of conspiracies. The most popular conspiracy theo-
ries are related to Chem Trails or Geo-Engineering. Policymakers should focus
on delivering targeted messages to Disbelievers about the scientiﬁc practicalities
of these conspiracies. Moreover, climate change Believers using Flat Earth con-
spiracy theory to target Disbelievers or their belief does not help clear scientiﬁc
facts. Our results suggest that Flat Earth conspiracy theory is not the most
popular conspiracy theory among Disbelievers.

Previous studies have concluded that Bot-like accounts stir conversations in
diﬀerently politically aligned belief groups rather than concentrating on conver-
sations in one belief group [20,4]. In this study, we further provide evidence that
Bot-like accounts were similarly active in sharing conspiracy related messages
irrespective of whether they showed activity akin to a Disbeliever or a Believer.

These bot-like accounts aim at widening the divide between belief groups and
pose a danger of creating confusion on scientiﬁc facts [4,7,14]. As more and more
people consume information via social media, it becomes imperative for these
platforms to identify and remove bot-like accounts.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst attempt to ﬁnd con-
spiracy theories in climate change in a large social media dataset. We ﬁnd that
some conspiracy theories are more popular and used widely to justify climate
change compared to others. Future psychology and social science scholarship
should divide conspiratorial thinking into diﬀerent types of conspiracies. This
will help ﬁnd the underlying constructs and motivations, knowing which helps
target climate change communication messaging.

Besides the demographic representativeness of the data, there are other lim-
itations in this analysis. First, although we have many tweets about climate
change conspiracies, it does not encompass those interactions that do not in-
clude our collection keywords. Second, we use a proxy of keywords to classify
Tweets as conspiracy related or not. We do not make an eﬀort to ﬁnd if sarcasm
or negation is used to call out conspiracies; we leave this to future scholarship.
Last, we focused on the conspiracy theories recorded in media or found during
our search. Many more conspiracy theories could be widespread in the climate
change debate. Nevertheless, we believe that we were able to analyze the main
conspiracy theories more widely popular among general Twitter users.
